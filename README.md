# Heroes of Earth
#### Challenge: What is our Carbon Footprint?
#### NASA Space Apps Challenge 2020

Heroes of Earth will assist the user to find out how he/she contributes to carbon emission, what activities and tools he uses that emits carbon and in what amount. It will help him to figure out how he can reduce the amount of carbon emission in his daily activities. It will set him various goals in his day to day life and assist him to complete them, thus change his lifestyle to reduce the carbon emission.

At the same time, the game will also work as a medium for survey on the people’s activities and lifestyle affecting the Carbon Footprint. These mass user data (excluding all personal data) will be stored in our server automatically. By analyzing them and using appropriate attributes, we’ll create a dataset that can be used for research purposes and make it free for everyone. We believe this dataset will be helpful for scientists and researchers to analyze the human lifestyle for mapping carbon sources and sinks.
